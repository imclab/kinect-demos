#Kinect Parallax#

This is just a quick demo showing background removal, using both threshold as well as a captured depthmap (and image) of the empty scene.

Any foreground objects are then (arbitrarily) moved forward in the scene, and due to the motion, a paralax effect can be observed.

If the depth information were to actually used in offsetting the foreground object, a pretty convincing effect could be achieved for applications the don't require too much depth in the scene, like a head tracking effect.
