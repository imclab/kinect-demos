#Kinect Kart#

Controlling mario kart with Microsoft kinect

I use the depth information to detect the position of both of my hands as well as the position of my leg. These inputs are then mapped to keyboard keys to be used as input in other applications. In this case an SNES emulator.

## A note on setup

Once the application is launched it will immediately start trying to detect hands and feet, if found it will send them imediatly. The bindings are as follows:

- **"Steer" left**: left arrow key
- **"Steer" right**: right arrow key
- **foot "pedal"**: 'z' key

You should configure your emulator so that these keys map to d pad left/right, and B (Assuming you are using an snes emulator with Super Mario kart)

_sApologize for how poorly I play, its quite late, so didn't have much time to practice with this new input method :)_
